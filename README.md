# Endless Runner game using LWGL

This is a simple game made in Java as an attempt to learn graphics programming and how to make a basic game engine for
easy game extensibility.

## How to get it to run:

For Windows you change the value of ```project.ext.lwjglNatives``` line in the build.gradle file to ```"natives-windows"```,
and for Linux you change it to ```"natives-linux"```


## How to play

Up and down arrow moves the player up and down, and left and right simply moves the camera(it was left in to see how the
terrain is constantly generated).
